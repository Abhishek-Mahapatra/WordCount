# WordCount

The following is a minimal project created using jQuery and ChartJS as a tool of verification of Zipf's Law. When we list down all the words in English ranked by frequency, the Nth ranked word's occurrences are proportional to 1/N. Fascinating right ? When creating NLP models, we can predict how big our model will be based on how much text we are feeding it to learn - that's based on this same phenomena. The most mindblowing thing is, this holds true not just for English but for all languages!

The project takes a piece of text and gives an estimate of the deviation of the piece to Zipf's Law. A naturally written text will show less deviation while an unnatural text will show larger deviation
